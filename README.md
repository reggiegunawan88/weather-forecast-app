# Weather Forecast App

Weather Forecast App is a simple mobile-first web app that provides users with current weather conditions and forecasts.
The goal is to utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and the Unsplash API for dynamic background images based on the current weather conditions, so that we can deliver a visually engaging and informative forecast app to user.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm or yarn to install the app.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Environment Setup

To run the app properly on development environment, you must setting up API endpoint and Access keys for OpenWeatherMap, Unsplash, and Geoapify using your own keys.

To retrieve OpenWeatherMap API key, you can go here: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
To retrieve Unsplash Access Key, you can go here: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
To retrieve Geoapify Access Key, you can go here: https://www.geoapify.com/get-started-with-maps-api

After you successfully retrieved both keys, create a new .env file on root level project and copy paste the content from .env.example file, and fill each of the API key value.
It will looks like this later:

```bash
# BASE URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_WEATHER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://openweathermap.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_WEATHER_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_BASE_URL=https://api.unsplash.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_BASE_URL=https://api.geoapify.com

# SECRET KEYS
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY={your-api-key}
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY={your-access-key}
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOAPIFY_ACCESS_KEY={your-access-key}
```

## Getting started

After package installation and environment setup, you can run the development server by these commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Application Features and Functionalities

### Weather Data Display

- Display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
- Provide a 5-day weather forecast showing daily high and low temperatures and weather conditions.
- Dynamic background that adapt to current weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy). Also for sunny and cloudy, the dynamic background able to adapt based on day or night time.
- Provide description and advice based on daily weather condition.

### Dynamic Background

- Utilize the Unsplash API to fetch and display background images that correspond to the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy).
- Ensure that the background image adapt to the current weather conditions.

### Responsive Design

- Provide fully responsive (but mobile-first) for an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
